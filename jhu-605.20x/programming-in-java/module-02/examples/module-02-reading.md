The nice thing about Java is that it is very similar to the first language I learned, JavaScript. Many of the existing operators in JS, to include items like ternary operations (?:) and short-circuit evaluations (e.g. &&), also existed in Java. That being said, many of the code snippet excercises are not written out here in this module-02 examples area.

Another thing to note is the usage of bitwise operators hasn't been a common occurance in any of the coding I have seen or done thus far, so no exmaples from that part of the reading are present.

Multi-dimensional, basically 3D+, arrays also exist in Java, but the current usage of these is not as important as 1D or 2D at the moment (to me at least). The existence of these arrays is all I needed to know form the reading at this point. In addition, the usage of un-even arrays, where the number of columns or rows is not the same at each row or column, exists as a construct and may be useful for logging interesting patterns to the console; however, beyond that I do not see a usage of this feature in the short-term.
